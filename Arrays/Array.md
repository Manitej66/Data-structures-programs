# Arrays

An array is collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of same type together. 

â€‹																				(or)

 **array** is a data structure consisting of a collection of *elements* values or variable  identified by at least one *array index* or *key*



## C++ Array Declaration

```cpp
dataType arrayName[arraySize];
```

## Access Elements in C++ Array

In C++, each element in an array is associated with a number. The number is known as an array index. We can access elements of an array by using those indices.

```cpp
// syntax to access array elements
array[index];
```

## C++ Array Initialization

In C++, it's possible to initialize an array during declaration. For example,

```cpp
// declare and initialize and array
int x[6] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9, 15};
```
